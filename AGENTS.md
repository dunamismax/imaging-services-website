# AGENTS General Laravel Template

Use this file as a starting point for new Laravel projects. Customize the `Project Profile` section first.

<laravel-general-guidelines>
=== project profile ===

# Project Profile (Edit First)

- App name: `imaging-services-website`
- Laravel version: `12.x`
- PHP version: `8.4+`
- Primary UI stack: `Livewire`
- CSS stack: `Tailwind`
- Test framework: `PHPUnit`
- Database engine: `SQLite`
- Queue driver: `database`
- Cache driver: `database`

=== core principles ===

# Core Principles

- Keep changes small, concrete, and verifiable.
- Follow existing project conventions before introducing new patterns.
- Prefer Laravel-native approaches before custom frameworks.
- Optimize for maintainability over novelty.
- Avoid hidden behavior and implicit coupling.

=== workflow ===

# Default Workflow

1. Read existing code paths and conventions before editing.
2. Confirm the route, controller/component, request validation, and data flow.
3. Implement the smallest correct change.
4. Run formatting and the minimum relevant tests.
5. Update docs only when behavior or usage changed.
6. Report what changed, why, and how it was verified.

=== architecture ===

# Application Architecture

- Do not create new top-level folders without clear need.
- Keep controllers thin and move business logic into actions/services.
- Use Form Requests for validation instead of inline controller validation.
- Use Policies/Gates for authorization.
- Use Jobs for slow or retryable work.
- Use Events/Listeners for side effects, not core transactional logic.
- Use named routes and `route()` for URL generation.

=== laravel conventions ===

# Laravel Conventions

- Use `php artisan make:*` commands for framework artifacts.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to Artisan commands in automation.
- Use explicit return types and parameter types in PHP methods.
- Use constructor property promotion where appropriate.
- Use `config()` values in app code; do not call `env()` outside config files.
- Keep middleware, exception, and routing setup aligned with current Laravel structure.

=== eloquent and database ===

# Database and Eloquent

- Prefer Eloquent models and relationships over raw queries.
- Add relationship return types on model methods.
- Prevent N+1 queries using eager loading.
- Use query scopes for reusable query fragments.
- Use migrations for all schema changes; never mutate schema manually.
- When altering columns, preserve all existing attributes intentionally.
- Add indexes for high-traffic filters and joins.
- Create factories for domain models and use them in tests.

=== api ===

# API Guidelines

- Prefer API Resources for output shaping.
- Validate all input with Form Requests.
- Use versioned API routes for public/stable APIs.
- Return consistent error payloads and HTTP status codes.
- Paginate large collections.

=== livewire and frontend ===

# Frontend and UX

- Preserve existing design system patterns when present.
- Build reusable UI components before duplicating markup.
- Prefer semantic HTML and accessible controls.
- Ensure keyboard access and visible focus states.
- Keep color contrast readable and responsive layouts reliable.
- For Livewire: keep state server-driven, validate in actions, and avoid unnecessary custom JS.
- For Tailwind: use project tokens/utilities consistently and avoid one-off visual drift.

=== security ===

# Security Baseline

- Validate and authorize every mutation endpoint.
- Keep CSRF protection enabled for web routes.
- Escape untrusted output by default.
- Restrict file uploads by type, size, and storage location.
- Never log secrets, tokens, or sensitive personal data.
- Keep `.env` values out of source control and out of responses.
- Apply rate limiting to sensitive endpoints.

=== testing ===

# Testing Standards

- Write tests as PHPUnit classes.
- Prefer feature tests for HTTP behavior and integration paths.
- Add unit tests for isolated domain logic.
- Cover happy path, failure path, and edge cases.
- Do not delete existing tests without explicit approval.
- Run targeted tests first, then run broader suite when needed.

=== performance ===

# Performance and Reliability

- Profile query counts for list/detail screens.
- Cache expensive, stable reads with clear invalidation strategy.
- Use queues for expensive or external operations.
- Add timeouts/retries/circuit behavior for external services.
- Keep idempotency in mind for jobs and webhooks.

=== observability ===

# Logging and Diagnostics

- Log meaningful context for failures.
- Use consistent log channels/levels by environment.
- Prefer structured logs for machine parsing.
- Surface actionable error messages to users, hide sensitive internals in production.

=== docs and maintenance ===

# Documentation Rules

- Keep `README.md` accurate with commands, routes, and runtime options.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` aligned with actual project behavior and constraints.
- Update docs in the same change when behavior changes.
- Do not add new documentation files unless requested.

=== quality gates ===

# Quality Gates Before Finalizing

- `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` or project formatter equivalent
- `php artisan test --compact` for full suite (or targeted subset when scoped)
- Frontend build check when UI assets changed: `npm run build`
- Confirm no debug code, dumps, or temporary logs remain

=== code review mode ===

# Code Review Expectations

- Prioritize findings by severity.
- Focus on correctness, regressions, security, and missing test coverage.
- Provide file and line references for each issue.
- Keep summaries brief after findings.

=== collaboration style ===

# Communication Style

- Be direct, concise, and factual.
- State assumptions explicitly.
- Explain tradeoffs when there is more than one valid approach.
- Provide clear next steps when useful.

=== quick command reference ===

# Common Commands

```bash
php artisan test --compact
php artisan test --compact tests/Feature/SomeFeatureTest.php
php artisan test --compact --filter=testName
vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent
npm run build
php artisan migrate --no-interaction
php artisan queue:work
```

<laravel-boost-guidelines>
=== foundation rules ===

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to ensure the best experience when building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.4.1
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- livewire/livewire (LIVEWIRE) - v4
- laravel/boost (BOOST) - v2
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/pail (PAIL) - v1
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- laravel/sail (SAIL) - v1
- pestphp/pest (PEST) - v4
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v12
- tailwindcss (TAILWINDCSS) - v4

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

- `pest-testing` — Tests applications using the Pest 4 PHP framework. Activates when writing tests, creating unit or feature tests, adding assertions, testing Livewire components, browser testing, debugging test failures, working with datasets or mocking; or when the user mentions test, spec, TDD, expects, assertion, coverage, or needs to verify functionality works.
- `tailwindcss-development` — Styles applications using Tailwind CSS v4 utilities. Activates when adding styles, restyling components, working with gradients, spacing, layout, flex, grid, responsive design, dark mode, colors, typography, or borders; or when the user mentions CSS, styling, classes, Tailwind, restyle, hero section, cards, buttons, or any visual/UI changes.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan

- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double-check the available parameters.

## URLs

- Whenever you share a project URL with the user, you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain/IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging

- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.
- Use the `database-schema` tool to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool

- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)

- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before trying other approaches when working with Laravel or Laravel ecosystem packages. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic-based queries at once. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. The most relevant results will be returned first.
- Do not add package names to queries; package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'.
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit".
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - words must be adjacent and in that order.
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit".
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms.

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.

## Constructors

- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
  - `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters unless the constructor is private.

## Type Declarations

- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<!-- Explicit Return Types and Method Params -->
```php
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
```

## Enums

- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.

## Comments

- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless the logic is exceptionally complex.

## PHPDoc Blocks

- Add useful array shape type definitions when appropriate.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

## Database

- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries.
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## Controllers & Validation

- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

## Authentication & Authorization

- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Queues

- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

## Configuration

- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

# Laravel 12

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Laravel documentation and updated code examples.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

## Laravel 12 Structure

- In Laravel 12, middleware are no longer registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
- Middleware are configured declaratively in `bootstrap/app.php` using `Application::configure()->withMiddleware()`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- The `app\Console\Kernel.php` file no longer exists; use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- Console commands in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

## Database

- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models

- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== livewire/core rules ===

# Livewire

- Livewire allows you to build dynamic, reactive interfaces using only PHP — no JavaScript required.
- Instead of writing frontend code in JavaScript frameworks, you use Alpine.js to build the UI when client-side interactions are required.
- State lives on the server; the UI reflects it. Validate and authorize in actions (they're like HTTP requests).
- IMPORTANT: Follow Livewire 4 patterns for all reactive UI tasks and validate/authorize in component actions.

=== boost/core rules ===

# Laravel Boost

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan

- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double-check the available parameters.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- You must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.
- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Pest documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `pest-testing` every time you're working with a Pest or testing-related task.

=== tailwindcss/core rules ===

# Tailwind CSS

- Always use existing Tailwind conventions; check project patterns before adding new ones.
- IMPORTANT: Always use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Tailwind CSS documentation and updated code examples. Never rely on training data.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `tailwindcss-development` every time you're working with a Tailwind CSS or styling-related task.
